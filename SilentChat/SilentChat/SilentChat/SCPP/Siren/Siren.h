 Sample Siren JSON using the above keys (The below examples are pretty printed.):
 
 {
     "message" : "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.",
     "fyeo" : true,
     "shred_after" : 120
 }
 
 {
     "cloud_url": "https://cloud.silentcircle.com/6473649",
     "cloud_key": "8IDCiIM1oR7pwhElTLyjs62oeLvEtIfhv75PPeK-JHE"
 }
 
 {
     "request_resend": "0bfb71a4-d8fd-4410-b119-199c3596f296"
 }

 When communicating with a normal XMPP client, the unencrypted <body/> is converted into this JSON:
 {
     "message" : "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.",
     "plain_text" : true
 }
