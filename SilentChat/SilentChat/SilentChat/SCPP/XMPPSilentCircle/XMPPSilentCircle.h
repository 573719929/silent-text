/**
 * A set of JIDs, for which outgoing messages targeted at JIDs within this set will be encrypted.
 * This is the "whitelist" set for encryption.
 *
 * The following rules apply when matching JIDs:
 * 
 * 1. If the JID is of the form <user@domain.tld/resource>, only this particular JID matches.
 * 2. If the JID is of the form <user@domain.tld>, any resource matches.
 * 3. If the JID is of the form <domain.tld>, any user or resource matches.
 * 4. If the JID is of the form <wildcard>, anything matches.
 * 
 * For example:
 *
 * If the set was {"alice@domain.com/home"}, then "alice@domain.com/work" would not match.
 * If the set was {"alice@domain.com"}, then "alice@domain.com/work" would match.
 * If the set was {"domain.com"}, then "alice@domain.com/work" would match.
 * If the set was {"*"}, then "alice@domain.com/work" would match.
 *
 * 
 * Use [XMPPSilentCirle wildcardJID] to obtain the special wildcard "JID".
 * For example, if you want to encrypt all outgoing messages, then do this:
 *
 * xmppSilentCircle.jidsToEncrypt = [NSSet setWithObject:[XMPPSilentCircle wildcardJID]];
 * 
 * Obviously the two sets jidsToEncrypt and jidsNotToEncrypt should not intersect.
 * If you set this property, and an object in this set intersects with the current jidsNotToEncrypt set,
 * then the intersection is automatically removed from jidsNotToEncrypt.
 * In other words, in the event of a conflict, the most recent operation takes precedence.
 *
 * When matching, the strongest match takes precedence.
 * That is, if a match is found in both jidsToEncrypt and jidsNotToEncrypt, the strongest match wins.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * jidsToEncrypt    = {"alice@domain.com/home"}
 * jidsNotToEncrypt = {"alice@domain.com"}
 * 
 * A message to "alice@domain.com/home" would be encrypted.
 * A message to "alice@domain.com/work" would not be encrypted.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * jidsToEncrypt    = {"*"}
 * jidsNotToEncrypt = {"domain.com"}
 * 
 * A message to "alice@domain.com/home" would not be encrypted.
 * A message to "bob@company.com/work" would be encrypted.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * jidsToEncrypt    = {"*", "bob@company.com"}
 * jidsNotToEncrypt = {"company.com"}
 * 
 * A message to "alice@domain.com/home" would be encrypted.
 * A message to "bob@company.com/work" would be encrypted.
 * A message to "sue@company.com/work" would not be encrypted.
 * 
 * If a match is not found in either jidsToEncrypt or jidsNotToEncrypt, it is not encrypted.
 * It is recommended you use the wildcard in one of the sets to explicitly specify your desired default operation.
